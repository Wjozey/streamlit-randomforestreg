## Fish Weight Estimation From Measurements


The aim of this study is to estimate fish weight on the basis of some measurement of fish body structure. The model used here is Random Forest regression model. 
The dataset from [Kaggle]("https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market")

The columns in the dataset are are follows:
* Species: Species name of fish
* Weight: Weight of fish in gram
* Length1: Vertical length in cm
* Length2: Diagonal length in cm
* Length3: Cross length in cm
* Height: Height in cm
* Width: Diagonal width in cm
